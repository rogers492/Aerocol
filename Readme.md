# Aerocol 

Aerocol is a phone app.  It is a solution for the NASA International Space Apps Challenge: [My Sky Color](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/my-sky-color/)

Aerocol is developed using the [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/), which is based on the [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) programming language.  

Aerocol is written for Android, though Corona also supports IOS and Windows phone.
